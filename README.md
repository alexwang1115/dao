#### Description:

I am a Marketing Major Undergraduate with a love for coding. I took an opportunity to use this Final project to start my marketing portfolio blogs to help me with my admission to a master's in Business Analysis. The content of this Final Project is the Final Paper of my undergraduate major. We helped a Rose Box business improve their website design, improve online presence, find better customer segments and collaborate with complementary businesses. This is just the beginning of my website. I will be adding more content for the Business Analysis projects I did. For now, it’s just a simple blog site but it has its purpose to help me with my career

1st let’s talk about the user experience. 

The user can easily identify the purpose of my website in the subtitle “Innovation Business and Opportunities for Start-up companies.”. They can easily see my profile on the left side without needing to load an “About” page. These days, modern designs are more of big pictures and smaller text, that’s what I exactly did in the index for each of my new posts. We’ll be talking about each post later. On the side you can see a box for “Recent Post”, this is for the user to easily jump to the post they wanna see without needing to scroll a lot. Below that there is a “tags” box. We are now in the “gift” tag. If you click the coding tag there is no post yet but you can easily return to the index page with the link provided.

Now let’s talk about the posts. I made it a little easier to navigate for the user. I added an HTML link bookmark for the “web traffic” and “online presence” topics. Besides that, I added hyperlinks to the start-up company’s Facebook and Instagram pages. The rests are simple text and images. The user can easily return to the index page by clicking the “return” button. There’s also a button for all the pages called “Send me to the top”. It does what it says.

Now let’s talk about the code.

I feel w3schools documentations are easiest for me to apply and to learn web development so choose it. I used a lot of HTML elements and dependencies from w3schools and google fonts. I chose to insert the CSS file in the HTML file because I felt it’s way easier and better to design my website that way. The “Read More” buttons are Javascript onclick commands that send users to each post page. For clean and organized coding I put the asset files in an asset folder, added comments for each code section, and beautified the code. Lastly, I uploaded and published it live to netlify to show the world my portfolio. I accomplished this by uploading my files from my Visual Studio code to Github and then connecting my netlify to my Github repository.
